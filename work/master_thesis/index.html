<p><b>Abstract:</b>
In Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), the ultimate goal is to let vehicles communicate through wireless networks to provide safety, traffic efficiency and entertainment applications.
Aggregation contributes to this goal by reducing the bandwidth requirements that prevent applications from disseminating messages over a large area.
This ultimately allows applications to exchange high quality summaries of the current status in a specific region, rather than forwarding all individual status messages from this region, increasing the available information for all vehicles.<br/>
Most existing work on aggregation in VANETs has neglected to consider security, not providing any guarantees on the data that is collected.
Security for aggregates is important, because they may be used by other cars for decisions about routing, as well as traffic statistics that may be used in political decisions concerning road safety and availability.
The few works that discuss secure aggregation are limited because they require roads to be segmented into small regions, beyond which aggregation cannot be performed.
The main contribution of this thesis is the introduction of SeDyA, a scheme that allows more dynamic aggregation compared to existing work, while also providing stronger security guarantees for the receiving vehicles.
